#Let us define array1
array1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
#We will look at some basic operations
array1 * array1
#Should give out array([1,4,9,16,25])
array1 - array1
#Should give out array([0,0,0,0,0])
1/array1
#Should give out array([1., 0.5, 0.3333333, 0.25, 0.125])
array1[3]
#Should give out the 4th term of array1. That is 4
array1[2:4]
#Should give out array from 3rd term to 5th term. array([3,4,5])
array1[1:]
#Should give the array staring from 2nd term and going till end. array([2,3,4,5])
